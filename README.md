ZNC Docker For My Linode
========================

Adapted from https://github.com/jimeh/docker-znc

Notes
-----
1. run via ```docker-compose up -d```
1. make sure path to .pem file in znc config file is container path
1. push module still needs to be configured manually
1. I had an existing .znc directory to point too, not sure how well this will work starting from scratch. It might just work.
